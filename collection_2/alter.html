Embracing an edgy streetwear vibe, Owens manipulates fabrics into deceivingly light, cocoon-like silhouettes. The label has become synonymous with a glamorous-grunge style, and a daring, award-winning approach to design. </p> </div></div>

        <p>Julius is a Japanese fashion label run and designed by Tatsuro Horikawa. The label focuses on presenting a wide array of gothic inspired clothing, utilizing the color black extensively to explore its meaning in both Avant Garde, spiritual, and religious aspects of the designer’s life. Started as a primarily art related project, Julius has surpassed Horikawa's original label focus in Nuke, presenting in the Tokyo Collection annually since 2004 and growing to a cult status in both Japan and abroad.</p></div></div></div>
