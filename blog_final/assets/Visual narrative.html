				<h1><b>Lubalin's<br> Black &amp; White</b></h1>

				<p>Black and white typography is a classic medium, but the lasting impact Herb Lubalin's distinctive typography had on design sets his work apart.</p>

				<p>Lubalin designed many logos and print ads alongside his magazines. Though Lubalin rarely drew his lettering himself, he collaborated with others for his predominantly type-centric work.</p>

				<p>As his 1959 ad for Sudler &amp; Hennessy declares, Lubalin lets his typography talk; it is known for its expressiveness and illustrative nature, and it remains ground-breaking and unique.
