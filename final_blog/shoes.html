   <div class="post-s"><p>Sneakers are the essential items in men’s fashion. They cost range from twenty dollars to more ten thousands dollars. But, picking shoes are very important in mens outfit. You could mess up your whole outfit by picking a wrong shoes. These shoes I am going to introduce have certain aesthetics and put you in a certain class. Geobaskets that now become a iconic piece of Rick owens is one of chic sneakers that can go along with your any outfits. The shoes reminds of the crisp sculpture. 

BBS are best known for their dark aesthetic. Very little from the line is any color other than black, grey or brown. But this tan sneaker features the same build quality, leathers and design of it's darker siblings.

Calling much of Carol Christian Poell’s work “art” as much as “fashion” wouldn’t be entirely out of line. Many of his designs favor form over function. One of his signature pieces of footwear, the “Drip Trainer” is shockingly different upon first glance. The shoe is typically built of kangaroo leather, which is then dyed as a complete product after its construction, then dipped in latex and allowed to hang dry, creating a stalactite-type effect once dry. And if you’re wondering, they don’t feel that much different than regular sneakers – especially after the rubber wears down after a few wearings.
