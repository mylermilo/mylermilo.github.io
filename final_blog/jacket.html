   <div class="post-p">


  <p>Years ago, watching Rick Owens and his wife, Michele Lamy, beavering away in Los Angeles in a garret-like space at the Chateau Marmont, which was then crumbling, few fashion insiders would have bet on Mr. Owens’s staying power.That was the 1990s, when even the sinewy, California-bred Mr. Owens, a design school dropout with a background in pattern making, could not have foreseen the eventual impact of his frankly louche fashion experiments.He ensured his longevity nonetheless in show after show of pliantly sexy designs, staying true all the while to his maverick, goth-tinged vision: one embodied in a jacket from one of those early collections. The following are excerpts from a recent interview. </p></div>


   <br></br>
   <div class="post-p-1"> <p><strong>What do you think made that piece so compelling — and so widely imitated?</strong>

   <br></br>

It had angular flaps and an off-center zipper. It was languid and drapey and fit like a second skin; it was already washed before it was shipped. All kinds of women could wear it; it conformed to every age and shape.
<br></br>

<strong>How did you happen to think of it?</strong>
<br></br>

I was living off Hollywood Boulevard next to the Egyptian Theater, which was being rebuilt at the time. It was an Art Deco ruin, so beautiful and dramatic. I had access from a back alley. It was like discovering the inside of King Tut’s tomb — in Hollywood. The pillars, the wall friezes, they were mostly destroyed; the seats had been torn out. I was already doing the clothes and was very conscious of that Hollywood decay.
<br></br>

<strong>So decadence inspired you?</strong>
<br></br>

It became part of my shtick. And, of course, there were the movies; they used to have matinees at the Egyptian. I’d go in to get out of the heat. I would sit in the balcony and watch.There were 1930s black-and-white movies — Cecil B. DeMille. Coming from kind of a very conservative quiet little town, they were high drama: Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra, Amazons battling pygmies, a queen bathing in a acid milk, white peacocks and lions lurking on the stairways.
I’ve narrowed my influences down to those things: all that opulence and scale, those heroes and glamorous villains. It was an exotic world I could kind of latch onto.
<br></br>

<strong>Did you focus as much on the costumes?</strong>
<br></br>

Everything was in black, white and gray, the clothes dragging on the floor. It was very much about a languid, draped silhouette. That led in my first collection to those long, glamorous, second-skin gowns in gray that were kind of falling apart a little bit. It was the imagery I was thinking of when I was making all of that stuff.
<br></br>

<strong>The jacket too?</strong>
<br></br>

Around that time in Hollywood, Michele and I were held up by a gunman. Michele said, “We’re moving to the Chateau Marmont,” and we did. We were in this frumpy room over the kitchen in the back, but it was sweet, it was charming and a little sleepy. Helmut Newton lived down the hall from us. It’s where I did my first collection. The jacket was part of it; it was born in the Chateau.<br></br>

<strong>Was it an immediate hit?</strong>
<br></br>

Hard to say. I started doing shows in 2002. But I had been selling that jacket in stores in 1997, probably. I still sell it. I sell almost every piece in that first collection. It’s the foundation of everything I do.
