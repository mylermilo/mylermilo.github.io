        <p>Fashion Designer Heidemarie Jiline Sander was born in 1943 in Wesselburen Dithmarschen in Northern Germany. After her graduation from a school of textile engineering and two years in the United States, she began working as an editor for fashion magazines in 1963. She opened up her first boutique in 1968, in Hamburg. By then she designed a collection for the chemical company Hoechst using their Trevira fabrics. The first collection under her own label hit the market in 1973. Her designs are often compared with the Bauhaus architecture of the 1920s. Jil Sander herself refers to her stubborn character, when explaining why she notoriously returns to simple lines in cut and a highly sophistcated choice in fabric. </p></div></div></div>
