   <div class="post-v"><p>Vetements, the fashion label, which is running by a creative director, Demna Gvasalia has shocked fashion industry. Some people think it is the biggest joke of all because a cotton hoodie with prins cost 2000 us dollar! Vetements means in French "clothing". Demna said he designed clothes for the sake of clothes. It makes sense because he turned into a 60-dollars champion hoodie to a hoodie that cost more than 1000 usd. Vetements did collaboration with many brands and all the brands that once collaborated with Vetements have boosted their sales revenue. Vetements has weirdly attracted so many follower with no any specialty. The cotton hoodie does not have any special quality but its shape is extremely oversized. But, the printing on the hoodie has a special statement meaning something. Vetements make people think again about high fashion. Does high fashion mean really something? Whatever it is, is it worth that price? I personally bought a reversible hoodie by Vetements. I wanted it so much because I thought the graphic is weirdly trashy and appealing at the same time. When I got the hoodie, I thought to myself, I am an idiot! Spening 1500 dollars on this hoodie with cheap-feeling cotton could not be rationalized. But, at the same time, I love the hoodie. It goes with any jeans, trousers, shoes. Printing is subtle and attractive in an weird way. Maybe I am brainwashed into liking it. And I love the fact that it is hard to get it. Vetements makes small quantity. Here is an interview with CEO of Vetements done by High snobiety </p>

  <p> Starting off with “luxury is scarcity,” Guram explains how the brand believes that “luxury was always something that was scarce. Today, I don’t consider Louis Vuitton to be a luxury brand – yes, the quality is luxury, but if you can go to the store and get whatever you want, it’s not luxury…We had hoodies from the first season that sold out super quickly and we had thousands of requests to make the hoodies again. If we were to, we would probably be able to make a million in a day. It’s out of respect to the people that bought them first that we don’t.”“If something goes on sale, it means it was overproduced…it is always better to sell one piece less to a store and to be sold out than to sell one piece extra and to go on sale. Because once you go on sale, there’s no going back.”

On being selective to stay sustainable…

“It’s very important that once you start growing, you slow down the process of the growth. And you try to stay on a certain level…we reduced the men’s and just limited the amount of stores that can buy it. We put caps on women’s orders; for example, stores cannot buy more than 10 pairs of jeans and Italian stores are not allowed to buy more than four pieces of jersey in one style. In November, Barney’s asked us what the minimum for the order was. And I said: there’s no minimum, but there’s a maximum. And they said that no one ever speaks about maximum.”

On the price of the brand’s clothing…

“There are a few reasons. One is that we work with amazing factories. These factories are not cheap. Another thing is the fabric. For example, the hoodies Demna likes to use use molton cotton that is very heavy. It is almost 480g compared to the usual 240g. The price of creating this heavy cotton is double the price of creating a regular one.”
