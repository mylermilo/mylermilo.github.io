   <div class="post-r"><p>Raf Simons, who has been always one of notable menswear designer, did collaboration with famous photographer, Roberto Mapplethorpe. 
   This has been surprising to me because both has been my favorite artist. Roberto's work embraced a lot of ambiguity and sexuality leading to a wonderful composition. 
   Roberto's work dealt with sexuality but not in a gender stereostypical way. It is genious for raf to combine his collection with roberto's work.
   It is very minimal but edgy with the Roberto's work. Oversized sillouette has been used many times in these days but Raf did it in his own way.
   The price of collection cost range from 400 to 4000 dollars. From the last year, extremely oversized hoodie became staple for menswear and Raf presented a lots of oversized hoodies and crewnecks with Robert's works printed.

   <div class="post-r-1"><p> <strong> About Roberto Mapplethorpe </strong> <br><br>
   In 1972, Mapplethorpe met the wealthy collector Samuel Wagstaff Jr., then curator of contemporary art at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Wagstaff became Mapplethorpe's mentor, patron and lover, providing the polish and financial support to complement the artist's bohemian lifestyle. Exhibition text states that it was in large part because of Wagstaff that Mapplethorpe was so "adept at moving between uptown and downtown social circles, both socially and artistically." The curator's role in elevating Mapplethorpe's career is the subject of the 2007 documentary Black White + Gray.

Wagstaff's support perhaps gave Mapplethorpe the impetus he needed to delve into new, riskier subject matter. The Montréal exhibition transitions from portraiture to the artist's two other primary subjects: erotic male bodies and floral still lifes. Included are images from the artist's X, Y and Z Portfolios (1978-81), which depict the homosexual BDSM subculture, flowers and eroticized black male bodies, respectively.(from Seven Days)</p></div>
