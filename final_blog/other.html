  <p><strong>Rick owens is known for his darkwear and his tougue shoes. But, not so many people know he designs furniture too. Extremely cool and chic. The thick Marble table upgrades your house decoration. Once, on an interview, he said his collection is inspired pretty much from architecture or sculptures. I thought that made sense. Looking at his collections is like looking at well-crafted sculpture or a constructed artwork. Simple geometric shapes is presented through expensive materials. Every furniture he designs has down-toned colors, which you can see it is meant to be identical to his aesthetic. </strong></p></div>

   <p>“Pavane for a Dead Princess,” the first U.S. exhibition of his furniture designs, opens this weekend at Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn’s Salon 94 and includes a bed, modeled on his own, in alabaster and marble, and a matching daybed. Combined weight: two tons. As of Tuesday afternoon, Owens had yet to see the bed assembled and was busy trawling for nuts and bolts that his team of Parisian sculptors assumed they could pick up upon arrival in New York. Never mind how the furniture was going to make it up the stairs. “I think I was inspired by the space,” Owens said of Rohatyn’s Upper Eastside gallery, which is in her townhouse. “It seemed like the perfect place for alabaster.”Like Owens’s clothing, the furniture manages to be simultaneously brutal and elegant. Or as he puts it, “the bed is part Sleeping Beauty’s glass coffin and part Christ’s open tomb by way of Donald Judd and Richard Serra.” Dreamy. And moonlighting as a furniture designer has had other domestic benefits: it has allowed him to forge a new connection with his longtime partner Michele Lamy. “It’s tricky for us to do business together,” Owens says. “I’m pragmatic and impatient and she’s good at cultivating and nurturing the artisans. Imagine a gypsy and a fascist trying to organize a war together. It just doesn’t work. But this has been our most successful collaboration. Some beautiful things have come out of it.”
“The furniture — because it was never a necessity for us — was something that we just did for ourselves to indulge our own aesthetic appetites and our personal needs,” Owens says in his signature California drawl, on the phone from his studio in Paris. “When I was first starting the furniture, I was talking about my message of intent: it was something like, ‘a fur on a rock, next to a fire, in a cave.’ And I literally created a rock, the rock that I wanted…” he laughs. Owens sometimes attempts to dumb down his own complicated ideas, but later, he reels off his aesthetic influences. “There was Robert Mallet-Stevens, there was Brutalism, there was Marcel Breuer architecture and there were German bunkers.” Those antecedents are all there, reworked into the aesthetics of the chunky, sliced-up boulders he calls chairs and tables, which challenge the idea of a designer’s interiors line as run-of-the-mill soft furniture. (There are pillows, Owens emphasizes, that makes all that rock crystal and petrified wood somewhat more comfortable. (An interview from NY Times.)</p>
