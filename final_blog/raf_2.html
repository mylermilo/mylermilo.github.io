   <div class="post-v-1"><p>That he proposed doing a complete line with Sterling Ruby is not surprising, then. “Sterling Ruby is one of the most interesting artists to emerge in this century,” Roberta Smith wrote in a 2008 review in The New York Times. Mr. Ruby, who lives in Los Angeles, and Mr. Simons are also good friends. They first met about nine years ago, and they’ve had many discussions about art, fashion and the psychological challenges of being creative and working within commercial systems.

The two men have collaborated before; in 2009, Mr. Ruby, who works in a variety of mediums — ceramics, painting, sculpture, collage — made bleached denim for Mr. Simons. But this time their approach was very different.

“It was an A-to-Z collaboration,” Mr. Simons said the other night before their superb show in Paris.

Mr. Ruby agreed. Referring to a board of images showing each runway look, he said, “When I looked at the grid, I thought ‘There isn’t one thing here that isn’t the result of collaboration.’”

 <div class="post-v-1"><p> <strong> As Mr. Simons acknowledged: “I know in the art world there is a lot of skepticism toward fashion. But from the day I met Sterling, I had to change my mind. I thought this is completely different. Fashion also attracts him.”

Mr. Ruby said: “We both work in different genres, but we work with some heavy industries to a certain degree. This is a way for us to keep our autonomy.” He added, with a laugh, “We’re on the trajectory to create our own Bauhaus.”

Mr. Simons and Mr. Ruby met six months ago to discuss their men’s line and then, as each progressed on the collection, shared ideas via digital images or by sending things between Antwerp and Los Angeles.

“There were a lot of discussions about fashion versus labor, utilitarianism,” Mr. Ruby said. “In the end, we started to talk about what man represents, what are the iconographies that are still associated with him. We talked a lot about consumption.”

Mr. Simons added, “The consumption aspect is an important thing, I think.” Indeed, many years ago, when Mr. Simons returned to fashion after his break, he created a collection around that point, with models tramping on beds of compressed soda cans. “You know, it’s production, production, production,” Mr. Simons said. “Everything becomes so speeded up that it’s a product in itself.”

The difference this time is something far more sophisticated, and not obviously about one theme. Mr. Simons added, “It’s very much about work and craft — things you can just do with four hands.”

Labor, reuse, primitivism in modern society — these are also ideas that engage Mr. Ruby in his art. Many of the appliquéd surfaces of overcoats, made from graffiti-like scraps of words or odd bits of material, evoke his art. But the aesthetic cannot be unraveled from Mr. Simons’s work over the last 20 years.

For this viewer, the show was tremendously liberating — all those textures and colors forcefully resolved into wearable, masculine clothes that didn’t look like anything else on the fashion landscape. But for the collaborators, it must have been liberating as well.

As Mr. Simons said, recalling early discussions with Mr. Ruby, “What if we do these things and they can’t be mass-produced — if it’s not even possible to mass-produce them — why would we not still do them if we like them?”

Nodding, Mr. Ruby said: “The collection is a real crescendo between things that are completely unique, that will only exist as one, and things that will have a larger run as limited-edition pieces. I find the approach interesting, and maybe it’s a challenge to the fashion industry.”</strong></p></div>
