        <h3>Vetements</h3>
        <p>Paris-based collective Vetements grew out of a group of young designers’ desire to escape the continual rebranding and reinvention of the fashion cycle. Focusing on singular, impactful pieces with immediate appeal rather than thematic seasonal collections, the group presents refined alternatives to overthought design. Head designer Demna Gvasalia and collective members with previous ties to Maison Margiela, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga, Céline, and Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Arts bring touches of roughness and deconstruction to elegantly executed womenswear staples: oversized trousers and overcoats, raw hems, convertible dresses, elongated knits, and asymmetrical shapes. </p></div>
