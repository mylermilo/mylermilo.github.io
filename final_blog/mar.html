   <div class="post-v"><p>Everyone who's interested in high fashion might have heard Maison Martin Margiela. Margiela has been amazingly successful commercially from 90s to current and he gained reputation as a one of legendary fashion designers. Margiela's pieces from 90's runway have been still worshipped by his followers and reproduced as replicas. The designer himself has maintained his silence from a pulic view, which I think it is how people become more fervent about the brand. Of course, Margiela influenced so many designers and you still can see his influence on runways. Extremely oversized coat and shoulder pad blazer seems so familar. Vetements' head desginer, Demna Gvasalia worked in Maison Martin Margiela after Margiela retired from his own brand.  Margiela is known for its four stitches on back, which is considered the brand"de facto logo". I personally love the stitches on the back that looks like stitches on tailored garments. I love the concept of its craftmanship. But, Margiela said the purpose of stitches on back </p>

  <p> Oversized fits are extremely overdone, but the sort of extreme approach to volume that Vetements has made its own can be seen throughout Margiela history – most notably in the house’s Fall/Winter 2000 collection. Billowing trousers, engulfing outerwear and voluminous skirts created a larger-than-life aesthetic that’s heavily reflected by Vetements’ clothing – not to mention those extra-extra-extra-long sleeves that run throughout Gvasalia and co.’s collections.The sculptural, swollen sleeves seen in this jacket from ’00 can be seen in Vetements’ trench coats and leather biker jackets, too.A continuation of the reconstruction themes that run throughout the house’s work, Margiela SS99 featured some striking patchworked jeans that had been spliced together from mismatched fabrics. Vetements’ riff on Margiela’s denim comes in the form of some extremely dope (not to mention extremely expensive) denim with stepped, raw hems that have no doubt inspired many strapped-for-cash fans to take a pair of scissors to their own regular jeans.Other Vetements’ jeans look like two pairs that have been unevenly pieced together straight down the side seams, complete with pockets that look like they’re sliding down off the wearer’s behind.
