Only certain brands make high-quality leather bags or cotton. Rugged look of washed leathers can be found from brands like Guidi, Rick Owens, Barbara Gongini. Guidi uses very soft lamb leather and their oiled lamb leather has the amazing vintage feeling.

 <div class="post-v"><p> <strong> How about Rick's human backpack?</strong><br></br>

For his Spring/Summer 2016 show at Paris Fashion Week, Owens sent another model strapped to the walking model in over a quarter of the looks. The stunt, like the range itself, was inspired by themes of “motherhood and sisterhood, as well as nourishment and regeneration,” described by Owens as “women raising women, women becoming women and women supporting women — a world of women I know little about and can only attempt to amuse in my own small way.(from Hypebeast)”</p>
