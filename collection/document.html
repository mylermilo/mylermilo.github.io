        <h3>Jil Sander</h3>
        <p>Fashion Designer Heidemarie Jiline Sander was born in 1943 in Wesselburen/ Dithmarschen in Northern Germany. After her graduation from a school of textile engineering and two years in the United States, she began working as an editor for fashion magazines in 1963. She opened up her first boutique in 1968, in Hamburg. By then she designed a collection for the chemical company Hoechst using their Trevira fabrics. The first collection under her own label hit the market in 1973. Her designs are often compared with the Bauhaus architecture of the 1920s. Jil Sander herself refers to her stubborn character, when explaining why she notoriously returns to simple lines in cut and a highly sophistcated choice in fabric. Early on, Jil Sander enriched her collection by offering mostly coordinates, so that pieces could be combined freely. The delicacy of the colors, fabrics, and shapes Jil Sander chooses is aimed at women who prefer a distinguished and fitting look in every situation. These modern, self confident women look for subtlety and elegence in their appearence. Thus, the collections of Jil Sander avoid loud colors, are spartan in print, and are economical in the use of accessories. </p></div>
